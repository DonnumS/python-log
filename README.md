A very simple desktop app that lets you track exercises in the form of walking, running or cycling.

The app works by letting the user input the type of workout, distance travelled and time used. This data is stored in a local MySQL database. 

If the user wishes, it is possible to view data for each type of exercise in the form of a bar graph made using PyPlot
